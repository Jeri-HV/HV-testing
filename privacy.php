<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the way in which HealthiVibe collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users of its website.  We take personal privacy very seriously and are committed to protecting your privacy.  </p>

<h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>

<p>We may collect personally identifiable information, that is, information which can be used to contact or locate the person to whom it relates.  Examples include name, email address, mailing address and telephone number.  When you register to receive information from us, we will collect your name, email address and type of organization (if any).  You may always cancel your registration and remove your email from the database by following the link to "unsubscribe."  </p>

<p>Personally identifiable information does not include demographic information, such as age, gender, zip code or birth date. When you register to receive information about HealthiVibe, we may collect this information to show demographic trends or geographic reach.  We do not request medical information.</p>

<h2>Non-Personal Information</h2>

<p>We may also collect information from users to our site, which is anonymous computer information.  This information includes browser name, type of computer, IP address, operating system, domain name and access time.  This information is used for the operation of our service and website, to maintain and monitor quality of the website and to provide general statistics regarding use of the website.  Our site may use "cookies", which are placed on a user's hard drive for record keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about the user.  A user may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or alert you to when cookies are being sent, although if you decline the cookie, the website may not function properly.</p>

<h2>Use of Personal Information </h2>

<p>We use personally identifiable information in order to send you emails to share news and updates related to our company. On an exceptional basis, we may disclose your personal information for the following reasons:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>When we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law, including information requested via subpoena and court order.</li>
<li>We may report what appears to be illegal or fraudulent conduct to law enforcement authorities.</li>
<li>If we were to transfer assets or operations in connection with a sale, merger, bankruptcy, or other transaction, we may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring or merging entity.  If so, we will use reasonable efforts to require that your personally identifiable information remains subject to essentially the same protections as contained in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>HealthiVibe has in place security to protect personally identifiable information that you submit, which is aimed at preventing access to and misuse of that information or its loss or alteration.  We will always take reasonable steps to maintain a high level of security.  You should be aware there is always some risk in submitting personally identifiable information.  We cannot ensure or warrant the security or privacy of any personally identifiable information and you submit it at your own risk.</p>

<h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>We do not sell, trade or rent personally identifiable information to others.  We may share generic, aggregated demographic information not linked to any personally identifiable information regarding visitors and users of our website.  </p>

<h2>HIPAA Compliance</h2>

<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is the U.S. federal law that governs the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information by health insurers and health care providers, referred to as "covered entities."  HealthiVibe is not a covered entity under HIPAA and it does not apply to the personally identifiable information you provide on our website.</p>

<h2>Accessing or Changing Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>You have the right to see personally identifiable information that we hold about you.  To do this, you should contact us in the manner described below.</p>

<h2>Compliance with International Requirements</h2>

<p>HealthiVibe complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from persons in European Union member states and Switzerland.

<h1>Sponsors</h1>

<p>
Our team simply doesn't accept that a study requirement won't fly with patients, leading to missed recruitment goals or high dropout rates. It should never get to that point in the first place. Instead, our platform is built on a foundation of driving collaboration early on&mdash;asking patients what they think about study requirements so that effective, patient-friendly changes can be made before the trial is conducted.
</p>

<p>
It's not enough to tap into digitally-enabled forums such as social media networks and online communities. You should be accessing large, representative patient populations at the protocol level. Building clinical trial interest... assessing visit schedule burden... or assessing a patient's ability to use an eDiary&mdash;whatever the challenge&mdash;HealthiVibe's unique platform can be leveraged to address it.
</p>

<h2>Partnerships that lead to success</h2>

<p>
Our team of research, clinical trial and patient engagement experts partner with you to design and execute cost-effective and innovative initiatives that provide results for clinical programs as well as for the more expansive pharmaceutical landscape. We are driven to capture all aspects of the patient experience, not just one little nook.
</p>

<p>
We are able to tap into our extensive experience and our creative process to deliver superior feedback. We also understand the regulatory constraints often imposed on trial sponsors and are able to offer tangible, actionable recommendations that won't violate any legal or regulatory mandates. Helping our clients navigate often complicated approaches and finding ways to balance the interests of multiple stakeholders is one of our strengths.
</p>

<p>
If you're looking to improve your clinical trials by making them more patient-centric and ultimately, more successful&mdash;and if you're looking to change the future of the pharmaceutical landscape based on drilling deep into the patient experience and bringing together scientific, behavioral and operational aspects of patient centricity initiatives, then team up with HealthiVibe.
